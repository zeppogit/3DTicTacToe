# 3DTicTacToe
a 3D Tic Tac Toe game written in C++

This was for a final project the second half (C++) of a C/C++ class taken at the University of Louisville.   

The project was written with classmate John Self for purposes of practicing collaboration.  My game class was paired with John's player class. 

The project was compiled and run using Dev-Cpp 5.4.2 TDM-GCC x64 4.7.1
