# 3DTicTacToe
a 3D Tic Tac Toe game written in C++

This was for a final project the second half (C++) of a C/C++ class taken at the University of Louisville.   

The project was written with classmate John Self for purposes of practicing collaboration.  My game class was paired with John's player class.
